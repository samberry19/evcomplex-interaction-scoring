# EVcomplex interaction scoring

This is code for using [EVcomplex](https://elifesciences.org/articles/03430) to generate "interaction scores" for individual sequences 
in a multiple sequence alignment, as done in the paper:

## Installation and setup

Additionally, mutliple sequence alignments are dealt with and analyzed using code from the alignment-tools script:

Inquiries about the code should be addressed to sberry@g.harvard.edu.
